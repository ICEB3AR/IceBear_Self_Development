What's the point?
=================
XMPlay is a Win32 (Windows 95/98/NT/2k/ME/XP/etc...) audio player, supporting
several formats. Initially, when XMPlay was first released in 1998, only the
XM format was supported, hence the name "XMPlay".

Stream formats
--------------
* OGG - Ogg Vorbis
* MP3 - MPEG1/2/2.5 layer 3
* MP2 - MPEG layer 2
* MP1 - MPEG layer 1
* WMA - Windows Media Audio
* WAV - any format that has a codec installed
* CDA - CD Audio

WMA playback requires the Windows Media Format modules to be installed. They
come installed with Windows Media player, so will already be on most users'
systems, but they can also be installed separately (WMFDIST.EXE is available
at the XMPlay website). If these modules are not installed, XMPlay will still
work fine, just without WMA support.

Module (MOD) formats
--------------------
* MO3 - Modules with MP3 or OGG encoded samples
* IT  - Impulse Tracker modules
* XM  - FastTracker 2 modules
* S3M - ScreamTracker 3 modules
* MTM - MultiTracker modules
* MOD - Generic module formats
* UMX - Unreal/Tournament music package

XMPlay's got the best (most accurate to FT2) XM reproduction to be heard
from any player. All features/effects (including several FT2 quirks) are
100% supported. The IT reproduction is also practically balls-on, with full
support for all effects/NNA/DCA/filters etc... additional features like
stereo samples and DMO effects are also fully supported.

XMPlay also supports the MO3 format (modules with MP3 or OGG compressed
samples). If you wish to create MO3s, then you should download the MO3
encoder from the XMPlay website (URL below).

Plugins
-------
As well as the listed formats with built-in support, a whole load more
formats can be played with XMPlay too, via plugins. XMPlay has it's own
native "input" plugin system but can also use Winamp plugins.


The main window
===============
In the main display area, the title, playback time and other basic info
about the current track are shown. The time display can be switched (by
clicking on it) between the time passed, the time remaining, or the
order/frame/page position (depending on if it's a MOD/MPEG/OGG format
being played).

Below that is the position indicator, which can also be used to change
the playback position. When streaming from the net, it will light-up to
indicate how much of the file has been downloaded so far (if the file is
of a fixed length). Right-clicking gives the option of bookmarking the
current position, or resuming an already bookmarked position.

NOTE: The bookmark is not retained when closing XMPlay.

The next 2 sliders control the volume and balance. The row of buttons
below the sliders are...

TIP: The volume can be adjusted using the mouse-wheel, when the mouse is not
     above anything else scrollable.

Track info & extended playlist:
    Opens/closes a window to display information on the current track, also
    a playlist and library. See "The info window" below.

NOTE: Some skins may also have separate buttons to access the playlist and
      library.

Previous track:
    Play the previous track in the playlist, skipping over any that are set
    to "skip". Right-clicking jumps to the previous sub-song in a multi-song
    track (or previous cue point when a CUE sheet is present).

Stop:
    Stops playback, and sets the position to the start. Pressing again when
    already stopped, unloads the track.

Play / Pause:
    Toggles play/pause of the track. If no track is loaded, then the currently
    selected track in the playlist is loaded (or the 1st track if none is
    selected). Right-clicking plays a random track.

Next track:
    Play the next track in the playlist, skipping over any that are set to
    "skip". Right-clicking jumps to the next sub-song in a multi-song track
    (or next cue point when a CUE sheet is present).

Open file(s):
    Opens and plays file(s). If you open an FTP directory URL, XMPlay will
    automatically scan the directory for playable files. Right-click to open
    a directory.

Looping switch:
    This can be set to never loop, always loop, or auto loop (only files
    that are apparently intended to be looped). When looping is enabled,
    you can also choose (by right-clicking) to have the tracks looped only
    once. Auto looping can also be set to apply to MODs only.

When you drag'n'drop files into the main panel, they are opened as if the
"Open file(s)" button had been used - ie. playlist cleared and new tracks
added. As well as files, whole directory trees and shortcuts can also be
drag'n'dropped into XMPlay.

TIP: Double-click on any non-button area to toggle mini mode.

TIP: Right-click the minimize button to minimize to the tray.

TIP: Right-click the close button to have playback continue from the
     current position the next time XMPlay is loaded.

TIP: When moving the window, right-clicking will make the info window move
     too. The same is true when moving the info window.


The "Output Options" panel
==========================
The response speed to all these options is dependant on the buffer size,
the delay will be the length of the buffer chosen in the device setup.

Interpolation switch:
Ramping switch:
Surround Sound switch:
Pan separation slider:
    See the "MOD" section below for details on these.

TIP: Right-clicking the pan separation slider gives options to set it to
     FT2 and Amiga levels.

Auto amp reduction switch:
Amplification slider:
Equalizer switch & sliders:
Reverb switch & sliders:
    See the "DSP" section below for details on these.

TIP: Right-clicking the amplification slider will reset it to the default
     level.

Top-left disk switch
--------------------
When switched on, this enables the automatic loading of settings that have
been saved for the track being loaded. Right-clicking brings up options to
load settings specific to the file, load settings for the file's path, and
load presets. See the "Saved settings" section below.


The playlist panel
==================
Double-clicking on a track will make XMPlay play the track. Right-clicking
brings up further options to play the track, to write a copy to disk while
playing the track (URLs only), queue the track, skip the track, add it to
the library, display track info, and remove the track.

If an internet stream is of a fixed length (a file on an FTP/HTTP server),
the "Write to disk" option can be selected while the track is already playing
(or has even finished playing), and XMPlay will write the portion that has
already been downloaded and continue to write the remainder that is being
downloaded. So you can preview the track before deciding if you want to keep
it, without having to start downloading it again.

Shoutcast/Icecast/Icecast2 streams that include the track titles, can be
automatically split into the separate files when writing them to disk.

Tracks that are set to be skipped are displayed in a small dimmed font. Dead
tracks are indicatied by red lines through them - a single red line means
the track is unplayable, while a double line means it can't even be opened,
eg. doesn't exist. The currently opened track is signified with a light-blue
arrow. Tracks that are queued for playback have a smaller light-blue arrow,
and the queue position next to it.

Files can be added to the list by drag'n'dropping them from Windows Explorer.
Whole directory trees and shortcuts can also be drag'n'dropped into the list.
URLs can also be dragged from web-browsers. The new tracks are inserted into
the position that you dropped them.

Queue:
    This toggles listing the tracks that are queued for playback, instead of
    the entire playlist. The queued tracks can be rearranged and generally
    manipulated just like in the playlist.

Bottom buttons
--------------
Random play order:
    Plays the tracks in random order. Right-clicking brings up more options
    to shuffle the list, sort by filename or title, and to reverse the order.

Save list:
    Writes the list to a PLS file.

Add to list:
    Adds files/URLs to the list. Right-clicking allows you to add all tracks
    in a directory (and sub-directories) to the list. If you add an FTP
    directory, XMPlay will scan it for playable files, and add them all to
    the list.

Remove from list:
    Removes the selected track from the list. Right-clicking gives further
    options to remove duplicates tracks, dead tracks, and all tracks. There
    are also options to refresh the dead tracks and clear the queue.

Loop list:
    If ticked, XMPlay plays the first track in the list again after the last
    track. Right-clicking gives the option whether XMPlay should go onto the
    next track when the current one ends, whether playback should stop at a
    dead track or at the end of a queue, and whether to unload the final track
    when finished.

Next to the buttons is the total list duration (clicking it will switch it to
a track count display). When multiple tracks are selected, the display will
alternate between the list total length, and the selected tracks length.

TIP: You can scroll the list using the mouse-wheel, and drag tracks up/down
     the order. You can also drag tracks from XMPlay into other programs, by
     clicking the right button while holding the left button down. Multiple
     tracks can be selected using the standard ctrl/shift+click methods.

TIP: A track can be queued for playback by clicking the middle mouse button.

The playlist is duplicated in the info window, where it can be resized.


The 'Options and stuff' window
==============================
Clicking the spanner icon in the main panel, or right-clicking on any non-
button area gives the option to open the 'Options and stuff' window, which,
as the name suggest, contains options and stuff. A description of the page
contents follows...


Miscellaneous
-------------
Track looping:
    This controls looping, as with the switch in the main panel (above).

Fade-out:
    When a looping track is detected, rather than have a sudden stop at the
    end, XMPlay can smoothly fade it out. The length of the fade (in seconds)
    is determined here. If set to "0", no fading is performed.

Only once:
    If enabled, tracks will only be looped once (when looping is enabled).

MOD only:
    When enabled, "auto looping" will only apply to MODs.

Maximum text width:
    This restricts the width of info window texts (eg. tags), and wraps any
    text that exceeds the specified width. Setting it to 0, disables it.

Restrict rendering:
    Visual plugins can take a very high amount of CPU when the window is
    expanded to a large size. Using this option restricts the rendering to
    the dimensions specified, beyond which the rendered image is stretched
    to fit the window.

Buffer:
    This determines how large a buffer (in seconds) is used when streaming
    from the net. The larger the buffer is, the less likely it is that the
    playback will be interrupted, but it also means that you have to wait
    longer for the track to start playing (75% is prebuffered). This option
    does not affect Winamp plugins.

Proxy:
    If enabled, XMPlay will connect to the net via a proxy. The proxy config
    goes in the adjacent box, in the form of "user:pass@server:port". If the
    box is left empty, XMPlay will use the Windows proxy settings set in the
    Internet Options control panel. If only the "user:pass@" part is provided,
    then XMPlay will use the user/pass details with the server in the Windows
    proxy settings. If only the "server:port" part is provided, then that
    server will be used without any user/pass authentication.

Restrict download rate:
    If enabled, the download rate is restricted to the rate required to
    sustain playback. Otherwise, the file will be downloaded as quickly
    as the internet connection allows. This option does not affect WMA
    file streaming or Winamp plugins.

Auto reconnect:
    This tells XMPlay to automatically try to reconnect whenever it gets
    disconnected from a Shoutcast or Icecast server.

On top:
    These 2 switches determine whether XMPlay will stay on top of other windows
    when in "normal" and/or "mini" mode.

Always in tray:
    This removes XMPlay from the taskbar, and puts the icon in the tray.
    A side-effect of this is that XMPlay is removed from the "Alt-Tab"
    list. Instead, you can bring XMPlay to the foreground by clicking on
    the icon in the tray.

Store per-user config/etc:
    This allows multiple users to share a single XMPlay "installation", without
    interfering with each other's settings, playlist, library, etc...

Allow multiple instances:
    When enabled, multiple copies of XMPlay can be running at the same time.
    When disabled, attemping to run XMPlay while it's already running will
    just result in the command-line being passed onto the already running
    instance.

Save play pos on closing:
    When enabled, XMPlay will store the current playback position when it's
    closing, and then resume it when XMPlay is next loaded. This also has
    the effect of reversing the close button operation, ie. it won't store
    the position when right-clicked.

Move info window with main:
    When enabled, moving the main window will also move the info window. It
    does not apply the other way - moving the info window will not also move
    the main window. The right-click while moving action is also reversed by
    this option, ie. it'll stop the info window moving.

Fading bubbles:
    When enabled, the help bubbles will be faded in and out. This option is
    only available on Win2k/XP and above.


Playlist
--------
Auto advance:
    Tells XMPlay to go onto the next track when the current one ends.

Random:
    Plays the tracks in random order. XMPlay keeps record of which tracks
    have been played, so that they are not randomly played again until
    the others have also been played. The "retain" option makes XMPlay
    retain the record of which tracks have been played when it's closed,
    otherwise it'll start from scratch the next time XMPlay is loaded.

NOTE: Toggling the random switch clears the record of which tracks have
      been played.

Loop list:
    If enabled, XMPlay plays the first track in the list again after the
    last track.

Stop at dead track:
    If a "dead" track is encountered XMPlay will stop (not advance).

Stop at end of queue:
    After playing all queued tracks, XMPlay will stop (not advance).

Unload final track:
    When XMPlay reaches the end (stops advancing), it'll unload the last
    track that was played.

Follow current track:
    These options determine whether the playlist views should automatically
    jump to the track when opening a new track.

Auto add to library:
    This option tells XMPlay if/when it should automatically add tracks to
    the library. When set to "on play", tracks will be added to the library
    when they're played. When set to "on list", tracks will also be added
    to the library when they're added to the playlist.

Abbreviate file sizes:
    When enabled, the file sizes will be shown in abbreviated form, eg. 1000
    becomes 1.0K and 1000000 becomes 1.0M.

Expand chopped text in line:
    Sometimes text may be too long to fit in it's display area. In that case,
    with this option enabled, leaving the mouse over the text for a second
    will cause the text to be expanded across subsequent columns. If this
    option is disabled (or the text doesn't fit "in line"), it'll be shown in
    a bubble instead.

Show overridden tags in Message info:
    When enabled, and a track with overridden tags is played, the tags will
    be shown in the "Message" info window.

Verify new files:
    If enabled, XMPlay will verify that files that you open are playable
    before they are put in the playlist or library (except URLs, which are
    not verified). The contents of directories are always verified before
    being added.

Don't add duplicates:
    If this option is enabled, whenever an attempt is made to add a track
    which is already in the list, the track already in the list will just
    be selected - it won't be added again. Note this option doesn't affect
    the library (there are never duplicates in there).

Scan HTML pages for URLs:
    This makes XMPlay scan webpage URLs for links to playable files, which
    it then adds to the playlist (or library).

Show queue in playlist panel:
    When enabled, the playlist panel will show the tracks that are queued
    for playback, instead of the entire playlist. Note this does not apply
    to the extended playlist in the info window.

Show filenames in extended list:
    Makes XMPlay show the filenames (rather than titles) in the info window
    playlist.


Dead
----
If you rearrange your music files, it could leave you with a load of "dead"
tracks in XMPlay and a lot of work to fix them, particularly the library
entries. That's where this options page comes into play.

All missing files from the playlist and library are listed. You can either
manually correct them (type the new location), or more conveniently, scan
directories (including sub-directories) for the missing files. Whenever
possible, XMPlay will not only check for filename matches, but also file
sizes, to reduce the chance of false-positives (same filename but different
contents). This depends on the original file's size being known, eg. in the
library.

Automatically check other drives for missing files:
    When XMPlay encounters a missing file, and this option is enabled, it
    will look for the file at the same path on the other drives.

Remove all dead:
    This removes all dead tracks (both non-existant and just unplayable)
    from the playlist and library.


Integration
-----------
You can set XMPlay to be the default player for the formats it supports. So
that whenever you "open" a file from within Windows Explorer, it is opened
by XMPlay. A file type association can be removed by unselecting it.

The icon that is displayed for files associated with XMPlay is shown to the
bottom-right of the "file types" list. It can be changed by clicking on it.

Add to XMPlay-list:
    This adds an "Add to XMPlay-list" option to the shell context menu of
    files (and folders) associated with XMPlay. Using this menu option results
    in the files just being added to the playlist, without playing them or
    clearing the list.

Add to XMPlay-library:
    This adds an "Add to XMPlay-library" option to the shell context menu of
    files (and folders) associated with XMPlay. Like "Add to XMPlay-list",
    except it adds the files to the library instead of the playlist.

Folders:
    This enables the context menu options for folders/directories. With
    the "sub" option enabled, XMPlay will search sub-directories for
    playable files too - this setting also applies when drag'n'dropping
    directories into XMPlay, and when they're in the command-line.

Monitor the clipboard URLs:
    XMPlay can monitor the clipboard for URLs of playable files, which
    it will automatically play or add to the playlist. When you see a
    playable file on a webpage, simply right-click and "Copy Shortcut"
    to have XMPlay stream it.

Add tracks to list:
    If enabled, tracks opened from Windows Explorer or the clipboard are
    only added to the playlist, without clearing the list first. It's as
    if the "Add to XMPlay-list" option was used.

Play listed tracks:
    When enabled, XMPlay will start playing tracks that are added to the
    list via external means (not when using the "Add to list" button).

Desktop:
    Places a shortcut to XMPlay on the desktop.

Quick launch:
    Places a shortcut to XMPlay in the quick launch bar.


Titles
------
Here you can choose how XMPlay should format the title of the tracks,
based on the tags contained in them. Tags are not available from Winamp
plugins, so the formatting won't generally apply to them (they'll usually
have their own formatting options), but XMPlay will read ID3v1, ID3v2
and APEv2 tags from Winamp plugin played files if the "Apply to Winamp
plugins when possible" option is enabled.

TIP: It is possible to override a track's tags. See the "Track info"
     section below.

Some formats don't have tags, eg. MOD formats just have a title "tag".
This could make the titles messy when elements are not available, if it
wasn't for the fact that the formatting can vary depending on what tags
are available. For example, the default formatting is:

    %?2{%2 - }%?1{%1|%0}

This means if the artist tag (%2) is present, use that and place " - "
after it. Then, if the title tag (%1) is present, add that, otherwise
add the filename (%0).

When a CUE sheet is present, XMPlay will use the title and performer info
from that when it's not available from the track itself. XMPlay will also
update the title at the CUE points, if the "Update title from CUE sheets"
option is enabled.

Scroll long titles:
    When enabled, titles that are too long to fit the title display will
    be scrolled.

Tray title bubbles:
    When XMPlay is minimized to the tray, and this option is enabled, a
    bubble containing the new title will be shown next to the tray on
    track changes.

Refresh all tags & titles:
    This option makes XMPlay rescan the tags/titles for all tracks, both
    in the playlist and the library.


Shortcuts
---------
Here you can fully customize how you control XMPlay via the keyboard. This
includes setting "global" shortcuts which can be used from within other
applications (ie. without XMPlay being in focus).

Multiple keys can be assigned to perform the same action, likewise multiple
actions can be assigned to a single key. When multiple actions are assigned
to a single key, they are performed in the order that they were added.

As an example, you could assign a key to select all search matches, invert
the selection, and delete selected tracks. That would leave you with just
the search matches left in the list.

Defaults:
    Resets all shortcuts back to the defaults as when XMPlay is first run.

These are the default shortcuts...

MOD
---
These options only affect MOD file formats (MO3/XM/IT/etc).

Interpolation:
    "Linear" interpolation "draws" a straight line between the samples,
    "Sinc" interpolation "draws" a smooth curve between the samples and
    requires more CPU power.

Ramping:
    Ramping makes volume and panning changes smoother so that sudden large
    volume/panning changes do not cause any "clicking" in the sound. It
    also fades-in (very quickly) new samples so that there is no click from
    them. Sensitive ramping only performs the fade-in when it's necessary
    to prevent a click, so percussive sounds stay sharp.

Surround Sound:
    "Mode 2" ignores panning, so is particularly good for mono MODs.

Pan separation:
    The higher the setting, the more sounds are pushed away from center.
    Obviously can only affect things when playing in stereo.

MOD playback mode - decides how MOD files should be played:
    FT2 = FT2 plays MODs slightly differently from the convention,
      infact most trackers play MODs differently from each other! Anyway,
      if you want to hear MOD files as FT2 plays them, then select this.
    PT1 = This plays MODs as the original ProTracker did, so now you
      can relive those early Amiga days! :)
    PT1 -filter = This is the same as "PT1", but with the Amiga filter
      disabled.

Show bpm/etc in time display:
    This option determines when, if at all, the number of active channels
    and bpm/speed are shown in the time display. When enabled, the active
    channel count is shown to the left, and the bpm/speed is shown to the
    right. The channel count will be inverted if any virtual channels have
    been killed within the last few seconds (due to excess CPU use).

Ignore muting:
    IT and S3M files can have muted channels, which XMPlay will honour
    when loading the files, unless this option is enabled.

TIP: Channels can be (un)muted via the MOD pattern display options (see
     shortcuts above).

Trim ending silence:
    If there is any silent space at the end of a track, it will not be
    played. Instead XMPlay will jump to the next track, assuming there
    is more than one track in the list, and looping is not on.

Extended effects:
    This enables support for the IT Yxx (panbrello) and Zxx (filter) effects
    in the XM and S3M formats. They are automatically enabled when DMO
    effects are used, as that indicates the file was created with MPT (which
    is what allows Yxx and Zxx to be used in XM/S3M files).

Shrink columns when channel count is:
    When there are a lot of channels, the MOD pattern display can become
    too wide for the screen. This option will cause the instrument/volume
    column to be removed when there are a certain number of channels, so
    that more channels can be fitted on screen.

MOD pattern scrolling:
    The pattern display can have the current position centered, or it can
    follow as the position goes off the display.


DSP
---
The response speed to all these options is dependant on the buffer size,
the delay will be the length of the buffer chosen in the device setup.

Amplification slider:
    This is different to the volume slider. The volume slider controls the
    level of the sound card output, the amplification slider controls the
    level of the actual decoding. The higher the amplification, the greater
    the dynamic range of the decoding output, but if it's too high clipping
    may occur resulting in distortion of the sound.

Auto-amp:
    This causes the amplification level to be automatically reduced whenever
    clipping occurs. With fade-in enabled, it will fade-in new tracks until
    they clip, then it'll behave the same as normal. Dynamic mode continues
    to increase and decrease the amplification level throughout playback.

Reset on new track:
    Resets the amp level to 0 dB (or replaygain value) when a track is loaded.

Replaygain:
    When a track has "replaygain" information, XMPlay can use it for the
    default amp level. XMPlay can read RG information from OGG files and
    APEv2 and ID3v2 tags. Native plugins may also support it, but Winamp
    plugins have no way of communicating that information. When a track
    doesn't have the preferred value but does have the other (eg. "Album"
    is chosen but only "Track" is available), it'll be used instead.

The bottom part of the window is dedicated to DSP plugins, and is fairly
self-explanatory. The "up" and "down" buttons can be used to change the order
in which the DSP are applied (top first).

There are 2 built in DSP - the equalizer and reverb. Most Winamp DSP plugins
can be used via the "Winamp DSP wrapper". You can create your own plugins by
using the SDK available from the XMPlay website.


Device
------
You can change which device (if you have multiple devices) to use, and
what sample rate/resolution/channels/buffer to use with the device.

You may also choose the "WAV Writer" device, to write the output to WAV
files rather than a soundcard. External encoders ("Encoder - ?") can also
be used to write compressed audio files, eg. MP3 or OGG.

NOTE: If looping is enabled while using a writer device, the track will be
      looped only once in the written file, even if the "Only once" switch
      is not on.

The amplification slider controls the volume level of the WAV. Be careful
not to use a too high amplification level as this may result in samples
being clipped. You can avoid any amplification problems by using the "WAV
Writer - normalized" device.

If the device does not support the settings you chose, XMPlay will use the
closest settings that the device does support. When a track's sample rate
is not supported by the device, XMPlay will automatically down-sample it to
a rate that is supported.

NOTE: The sample rate option only affects MOD formats. See the "Output"
      text in the "General" info window for the exact format of the output.

Dithering and noise-shaping are recommended when writing to disk (eg. to
burn on CD), but noise shaping is not recommenced if you intend to process
the written file (whenever possible, use 32-bit instead).

NOTE: When writing to disk (including external encoder), 32-bit is standard
      IEEE754 floating-point ("type 3" WAV).

Auto filename:
    This removes the need to select a filename when writing WAVs or using
    an external encoder. The files are written as the same name with the
    default extension added. Because no user interaction is required, writing
    is also continuous in this mode - it automatically moves onto the next
    track when the current one ends (if the "auto advance" option is enabled).

Separate MOD instruments:
    When enabled, and writing a MOD format to disk, each instrument will be
    written individually. The instrument number shall be appended to the
    filename.


Encoders
--------
Here you can add/remove/edit the encoders available to the device list.
Any command-line encoder can be used, optionally using STDIN, so that no
intermediate file writing is required.

The resolution of the sample data sent to the encoder will be as set in
the "Device" options above, unless it is overridden here.

Settings for the LAME and OGGENC encoders are provided, to use them put
the LAME.EXE or OGGENC.EXE file in the same directory as XMPlay. See the
support site for a load more encoders.


Plugins & Skin
--------------
The "input" plugins that are installed are listed here, with a list of
the file formats that they support. When changing a plugin's config while
it's being used to play a track, you may have to stop/restart the track
for the config changes to take effect.

TIP: A large selection of plugins are available at the support site.

NOTE: Only Winamp plugins that can feed the sample data to XMPlay (rather
      than use their own output device) are loaded, which is most of them.

The current skin name, and a link to the author's website or email address
is shown at the bottom of the page. If the author has included a "readme"
text, that can be viewed by clicking the "Readme" button.


Saved settings
--------------
Amp/DSP/looping/MOD options can be saved, to be automatically applied when
specific tracks are loaded, or saved as presets to be quickly set whenever
wanted.

When saving settings, the settings that are actually saved is determined by
the check boxes. The "MOD" box can have a greyed tick, which means that the
MOD settings are only saved if the current track is a MOD format.

* "Amp" is the amplification level and the auto-amp mode.

* "DSP" is the config of all DSP plugins that are currently active (in the
  DSP Plugins list).

* "Loop" is all the track looping options (Miscellaneous options page).

* "MOD" is all the MOD options page settings.

Before clicking "Save", you need to select what the settings will apply to.
There are 3 types of saved settings - "File", "Path", "Preset".

"Preset" is fairly obvious, and the saved settings can be accessed by right
clicking the settings button (disk icon) in the output options panel.

When XMPlay tries to load settings for a track, it will first look for a
"File" match. If there is none, it will look for a "Path" match. In the
case of there being multiple path matches, the longest match will be used.
For example, both "c:\" and "c:\blah\" match "c:\blah\blob.mod", but the
"c:\blah\" settings will be used.

The preset name or file/path of a saved settings can be edited by clicking
on the entry in the list.

TIP: An empty path setting will match all files.

Automatically load saved settings:
    This enables the automatic loading of settings that have been saved for
    the new track being played.


The info window
===============
The info window displays information on the currently loaded track. There
are 4 modes...

General:
    Displays info on the file's name, format, size, length, etc...

Message:
    Displays any messages or tags contained in the file, including the
    current track name when streaming from Shoutcast servers.

Samples:
    Displays instrument and sample texts (MOD formats only).

Vis:
    Displays visualisation plugins.

The window can be resized by dragging the edges, or you can have XMPlay
automatically resize the window to fit the contents by ticking the box at
the top (2nd from left). The mouse wheel can be used to scroll up/down.

Right-clicking gives the option to copy the window's text to the clipboard.
Any URLs that are present in the text can also be opened by right-clicking.

The 3rd button from the left toggles having the playlist panel duplicated
in the info window. Right-clicking the button opens the library (see the
"Library" section below). With "auto resize" enabled, only the playlist
display width is resized - the number of tracks listed is left as it is.

There is an extra button in the info window version of the playlist, with
which you can find tracks containing specific substring(s) in their title
or filename. Right-clicking allows you to choose to have only the matched
tracks played (the rest will be skipped).

The current and total number of tracks is also displayed in the top-right.


MOD Pattern Display
===================
The "MOD Pattern Display" visualisation applies to MOD formats only, and
allows you to get an idea of how the files were "tracked". For simplicity
and clarity, not all effects are shown and a universal notation is used
for all formats. The following entries are shown by XMPlay:

note
instrument (shown in green)
portamento (red)
tone up/down (red ^/v)
vibrato (red ~)
volume (blue)
volume up/down (blue +/-)

NOTE: All numbers are shown in hex, except the row number.

Shortcuts can be set to scroll the display when all the channels do not
fit in the display. Channels can also be muted via shortcuts. See the
shortcuts options page.

By default, the pattern display will have the current position centered,
but you can also have it scroll as the position goes off the display. The
scroll mode is toggled by clicking the middle mouse button.

TIP: The width of the channel columns can be changed depending on the
     number of channels. See the "MOD" section above.


Library
=======
The library is a sort of glorified playlist. Whereas the playlist just
contains each track's filename and title, the library contains a lot of
additional information. The full list of info contained in the library
is: filename, title, artist, album, year, track, genre, comment, file
type, file size, length, the play count and the time of last playback.

The tracks in the library can be sorted by any of these values, making
it quick and easy to locate the tracks you want to play. Click on the
column heading to sort by that value. Clicking again will reverse the
order.

You can choose which info is shown in the library by right-clicking on
the headings. You can also change the display order of the columns by
dragging them, and you can change the width of each column by dragging
the borders.

Files can be added to the library in the same way as they can with the
playlist, eg. using the add button or by drag'n'dropping them. They
can also be added automatically when played or added to the playlist.
See the "Playlist" section above.

The library uses the same GUI as the extended playlist. When used here,
all the buttons will take effect on the library, except for the random
and loop list switches, which still apply to the playlist.

Right-clicking on a track will give options to play the track, add it
to the playlist, view/edit track info, refresh the info, and remove the
track. Double-clicking will also play the track, and middle-clicking
will queue the track.

NOTE: When playing or queuing a track from the library, it'll first be
      added to the playlist if it's not already in there.


Track info
==========
The track info window is accessed via right-clicking on a track in the
playlist or library. In this window you can see some details of the track,
including the filename, tags, file size and playback length. The filename
and tags can be modified.

NOTE: Changes made here affect all copies of the track, ie. if there are
      multiple copies of the track in the playlist, they will all have the
      same modified info.

When overriding tags, the track's file is not modified - the tags are just
stored in the library. This means that any modifications will be lost upon
closing XMPlay unless the track is in the library. The "In Library" check
box indicates whether the track is currently in the library.


Find track(s)
=============
Using this window, you can search for tracks containing specific string(s)
in their title or filename. When searching in titles, the track's tags will
also be searched if they're available - that is if they're in the library
or have been read during playback or for the "Track info" window.

Using the "any" or "all" options you can search for tracks that contain
any/all of multiple words (separated by spaces).

As you type the search string, or change the search options, any matches
will be listed in the box below. You can click on a match to jump to it
in the playlist and/or library. Right-clicking will bring up options to
play the track, queue the track or view track info. Double-clicking (or
pressing space) will also play the track.

Include library:
    Enables searching of the library for matches, as well as the playlist.

Sort:
    When enabled, the search results are sorted alphabetically. Otherwise,
    they're left in the order that they're in in the playlist/library.

Skip non-matching tracks:
    XMPlay will skip over any tracks that do not match the search criteria
    when playback advances.


Dragon droppings
================
Files, whole directory trees, shortcuts, and URLs can be drag'n'dropped into
XMPlay. If they're dropped into one of the playlist panels, then the tracks
are inserted into the position they were dropped at. If they are dropped
elsewhere, then the playlist is cleared, and the dropped tracks are added
and played. Holding the shift key down as you drop the tracks reverses this
behaviour, eg. the list is cleared if the tracks are dropped in a playlist
panel. Tracks can also be dropped into the library or queue.

The files and URLs of tracks can also be dragged from XMPlay, into other
applications, by clicking the right button while keeping the left button
pressed.


Plugins
=======
Archive plugins are available at the XMPlay website, and a plethora of
input and visual plugins are available at the support site. To install
a plugin, simply put it in the same directory as (or a sub-directory of)
the XMPLAY.EXE file.

NOTE: XMPlay must be restarted to enable newly installed plugins.

Some visualisation plugins support button-clicks, for example, to set some
options. The middle mouse button is used to access that feature in XMPlay.


Skins
=====
Alternative skins are available at the XMPlay website. To install a skin,
simply put it in the same directory as (or a sub-directory of) XMPLAY.EXE.
To switch skins, go to the "Plugins & Skin" page in the Options and stuff
window, or right-click on any non-button area of the main panel.

NOTE: XMPlay must be restarted to enable newly installed skins.

A skinning kit is also available at the XMPlay website, should you wish
to create your own XMPlay skins.


CUE sheets
==========
CUE files can be used to quickly jump to specific points (eg. start of a song
in an album) in large files. When opening a track, XMPlay will look for a CUE
file of the same filename (with ".CUE" extension) in the same directory (or
archive). If one is found, it'll be loaded and the CUEs will be listed in the
"Message" info window. The sub-song shortcuts can be used to jump between the
CUE points. XMPlay can also update the title based on the CUE sheet - see the
"Title format" section above.


Latest version
==============
The latest version of XMPlay can always be found at the XMPlay website:
