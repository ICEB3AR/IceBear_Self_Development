     VB Decompiler is a decompiler for programs (EXE, DLL, or OCX) 
     written in Visual Basic 5.0 or 6.0. As you know, a VB program 
     can be compiled either into interpreted p-code or into native 
     code.
     
     Since p-code consists of high-level commands, it's possible to 
     decompile it into source code (though, of course, you won't get 
     the names of variables, functions, etc.). VB Decompiler  can 
     restore many p-code instructions. It cannot produce compilable 
     source code but makes it much easier to analyze the program's 
     algorithm and partially restore its source code.
     
     If some program was compiled into native code, you cannot 
     restore the source code from machine instructions. But even in 
     this situation, VB decompiler can greatly help you analyze the 
     program, thanks to a powerful disassembler that supports 
     Pentium Pro commands, including MMX and SSE. VB decompiler 
     lets you to disassemble all functions. It includes a code analyzer 
     too, which searches for all API function calls and string 
     references in the disassembled code and converts them into 
     comments for analyzed strings. In general, VB Decompiler is an 
     ideal tool for analyzing VB programs. It's a must-have if you've 
     lost some source code and need to partially restore your project!

     1. Install VB Decompiler Pro v9.2 RETAIL INCL.
     2. First, patch VB Decompiler.exe with the keygen
     3. Press Activate button.
     4. Have fun ;)
     
     Special greets fly out to 1ST ;)

     Note to Sergey Chubchenko (GPcH) :
     You discussed about reversing since 8 years on exetools board but you 
     are not able to protect correctly your softwares and you choose the 
     worst existing protector on the moment.
     At best it is laughable, at worst it is deplorable.
     We know a russian author. He is not on reversing boards but he made 
     a strong protection without any use of packer / protector...

     On the thread about VB Decompiler v8.1 on exetools, you wrote this :
     If VB Decompiler 9.x or higher will published then may be the next 
     step is a partially decompilation on the server side. All antiviral 
     labs (who use licensed VB Decompiler) will say you thank you for the 
     permanent online access requirments for new version of the 
     VB Decompiler. Think about it. Your fun is a big problem for the 
     legal users.

     We don't care about it. 
     Firstly, antiviral labs blacklist our cracks / keygens while there is 
     no trojan / virus.
     Would you try to make us cry ?
     Secondly, we don't use your soft. 
     You want to penalise your legit users ?
     You will shoot yourself in the foot and we will have a good laugh.
     
     Best wishes for Christmas and a Happy New Year ;)
